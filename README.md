Project Description 
Our project will be a “MyDiscussionForum” Style page, focused on creating a forum for discussion surrounding ChatGPT and other AI text generation models. This page’s goal will be to supply users with prompts to give to the AI models for different business/personal applications, as well as discussion and advice surrounding the topic of AI content generation. 
Creating or engaging with forum posts will be restricted to registered users and admins. Unregistered users will be able to view, but not create/engage with forum posts. Registered users will also have the options of personalizing their profiles, such as creating a unique name for themselves, and creating a signature for their posts. They will also have the ability to edit their posts, names, and signatures.
